# GAIA-IoT
A typical GAIA IoT infrastructure inside of a school building consists of the following components:
 Power meters installed inside electrical distribution panels.
 IoT “smart” plugs, that act as power meters in select building electrical outlets.
 IoT sensor boxes comprising sensing points for temperature, humidity, air quality, presence, and
noise levels, which are installed into select classrooms or other school building rooms.
 IoT weather stations, typically installed outdoors on the buildings’ roofs or select spots.
 IoT gateway devices, serving as local coordinators of the IoT network and connecting to the GAIA
cloud infrastructure and ecosystem.
All of the aforementioned IoT devices communicate wirelessly with each other, eliminating almost all
dependency on wired connectivity, apart from the gateway devices. Specific details on networking
technologies and protocols used are included in subsequent chapters,
